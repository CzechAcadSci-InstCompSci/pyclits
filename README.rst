What is pyCliTS?
--------------------
Python Climate Time Series package is open-source python package for easy manipulation with climatic geo-spatial time series such as the reanalysis or CMIP5 outputs, which are usually distributed as netCDF4 files. The package includes functions for:  

* manipulating the data [temporal and spatial slicing, interpolating, subtracting the climatological cycle = anomalising, normalising, filtering, subsampling, etc.] 
* computing continuous complex wavelet transform [CCWT]
* constructing spatio-temporal surrogate data using Monte-Carlo approach [Fourier transform surrogates, amplitude adjusted FT, iterative amplitude adjusted FT, autoregressive surrogates using the VAR(p) model, multifractal surrogates] 
* computing Singular Spectrum Analysis
* computing mutual information and conditional mutual information [using equidistant, equiquantal binning and k-nearest neighbour algorithms] 
* constructing an empirical model from spatio-temporal data based on idea of LIMs [linear inverse modelling].

Uses fast numpy, scipy and scikit-learn libraries and offers multi-thread computations when possible [e.g. computing wavelet transform per grid point].
